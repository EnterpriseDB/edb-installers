PostgreSQL Server Package
=========================

This is the build system for the PostgreSQL Server package. It is not 
designed to be run standalone, but as part of the PostgreSQL Installer
 build system. 

Build scripts
-------------

* build.sh

This is the primary build build script. It is responsible for prepping the clean
source tree(s) for building (exposed through _prep_server()), building the 
trees for each enabled platform (_build_server()) and building each installer
along with any other miscellaneous post-build tasks (_postprocess_server()).

* build-<platform>.sh

A separate build script is provided for each platform. On the host platform 
(Mac OS X), the commands are run on the local machine. For other platforms they
are generally run via ssh on virtual machines, or, remote boxes.

Directories
-----------

* i18n/

This directory contains internationalisation files for the installer. This will
typically be a message catalog for each language (including English), and in 
some cases, README & licence files. 

* resources/

This directory contains the graphics used by the installer. 

* scripts/

This directory contains scripts (which may be platform specific) used at runtime
by the installer. These may be pre-install, pre-upgrade, post-install, 
post-upgrade or any other script that may be needed. Note that scripts called by
the installer should return numeric status codes. These may be read by the
installer which can interpret them and display localised messages as required.

* source/

This directory contains the source code for the build. Typically the clean copy
will either be a source tarball or untouched CVS checkout. These are un-tarred
or copied prior to the actual build. This is managed by _prep_server().

* staging/

The staging directory contains the built tree for each architecture. For the 
host machine this is simply built locally. For other architectures, the build
output is written here through and NFS mount (for example). A common directory
may also be included for files common to all builds.

Files
-----

* installer.xml.in

This is the BitRock InstallBuilder configuration file. The build script will
pre-process this to insert version numbers etc. and save the resulting file as
installer.xml which is what will actually be built.
