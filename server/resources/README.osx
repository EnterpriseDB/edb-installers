PostgreSQL One Click Installer README
=====================================

Shared Memory
-------------

PostgreSQL uses shared memory extensively for caching and inter-process 
communication. Unfortunately, the default configuration of Mac OS X does
not allow suitable amounts of shared memory to be created to run the 
database server.

Before running the installation, please ensure that your system is 
configured to allow the use of larger amounts of shared memory. Note that
this does not 'reserve' any memory so it is safe to configure much higher
values than you might initially need. You can do this by editting the 
file /etc/sysctl.conf - e.g.

% sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf

On a MacBook Pro with 2GB of RAM, the author's sysctl.conf contains:

kern.sysv.shmmax=1610612736
kern.sysv.shmall=393216
kern.sysv.shmmin=1
kern.sysv.shmmni=32
kern.sysv.shmseg=8
kern.maxprocperuid=512
kern.maxproc=2048

Note that (kern.sysv.shmall * 4096) should be greater than or equal to
kern.sysv.shmmax. kern.sysv.shmmax must also be a multiple of 4096.

Once you have edited (or created) the file, reboot before continuing with 
the installation. If you wish to check the settings currently being used by 
the kernel, you can use the sysctl utility:

% sysctl -a

The database server can now be installed.
